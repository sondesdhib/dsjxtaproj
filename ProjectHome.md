In this project, we propose to implement software update system which will use P2P technology. The main advantage of using the P2P technology over client-server approach is distribution of the software is not on a single server, which makes it reliable and at the same time the peers can obtain the software from other peers, this approach reduces the overall latency in the network, and the overload on a single server. In this proposed implementation we will be able to update multiple files on the target software rather a single executable file, which makes our approach flexible compared to the existing software update approach that are prevalent.  With the power of able to communicate and share information with many peers in a decentralized environment, there also exists the problem of security. The intention of this project is to address the issue of security in the P2P software update system adequately, so the application using this technology is safe from maliciously attack, and we have discussed our security proposal in the sections below.
